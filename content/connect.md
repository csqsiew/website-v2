_hello at cloud dot csqsiew dot xyz_   

View my CV [here.](https://cloud.csqsiew.xyz/nextcloud/index.php/s/QoK4ca2AP4PGBA4)  

When I'm not doing research, I'm either climbing, strumming my ukulele, or hanging out with Dougie the Corgi. Sometimes I work on random things like making 3-d models of networks. Here is a shameless plug for my [Shapeways](https://www.shapeways.com/shops/csqsiew) and [Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/people/csqsiew) shops. Recently I have gotten very interested in ["de-Googling"](https://e.foundation/) my digital footprint, learning about [Linux](https://elementary.io/), and [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). You may find useful and random things on my [R Shiny server](http://r-server.csqsiew.xyz/).
