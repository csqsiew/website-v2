## Home-made package to convert linguistic stimuli to a network representation

My first R package! It basically takes a set of words and makes a language network out of those words based on the 1 edit distance metric. I have found this quite useful not just for constructing the usual language networks, but for automating the creation of multiple networks (e.g., in acquisition), and for making toy networks for articles and presentations, etc.   

`langnetr` needs a lot of debugging still so I welcome all of your feedback and comments.  

Since `langnetr` is not hosted on CRAN, there are a few extra steps required to download it--I've attached documentation below that has specific instructions for downloading and using it (see the Vignette).
