When I'm not doing research, I'm either climbing, strumming my ukulele, or hanging out with Dougie the Corgi. Sometimes I work on random things like making 3-d models of networks. Here is a shameless plug for my [Shapeways](https://www.shapeways.com/shops/csqsiew) and [Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/people/csqsiew) shops. Recently I have gotten very interested in ["de-Googling"](https://e.foundation/) my digital footprint, learning about [Linux](https://www.bodhilinux.com/), and [note taking apps](https://github.com/zadam/trilium).
